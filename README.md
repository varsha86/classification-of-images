 CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely-used benchmark dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.

 Motivation

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with numerous real-world applications, including object recognition, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis. This project aims to explore CNNs and their effectiveness in classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

 Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cifar10-image-classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd cifar10-image-classification
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

 Usage

1. Train the model:

   ```
   python train.py
   ```

2. Evaluate the trained model:

   ```
   python evaluate.py
   ```

 Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture used in this project comprises multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. Fully connected layers are then utilized for classification, with a softmax activation function in the output layer for multi-class classification.

 Results

After training, the model achieves a test accuracy of approximately 70%. Detailed training progress and evaluation metrics, including loss and accuracy, are displayed during execution.
